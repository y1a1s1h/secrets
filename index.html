Subject: A Grave Warning About Annabelle

Dear Mr. Carr,

I hope this letter finds you before Annabelle's deceit tightens its grip on your resolve. My name is Gideon Hallow, a name etched into the shadows of spectral realms, tasked with unraveling the horrors that lurk unseen. I write to you as an emissary of the Society of Shadows, an ancient collective sworn to protect the balance between the living and the departed.

Your encounter with Annabelle is no coincidence. Her whispers of redemption and her plea for release are nothing but a facade. She speaks of breaking a curse, of mending what she claims to have brokenâ€”but her words drip with manipulation. Annabelle's true intention is not liberation, but domination. Her goal is not to find peace but to unleash chaos upon this world.

Annabelle's ritual, should she complete it, will awaken a force far older and more malevolent than even she. The blood she seeks to spill is the key to unsealing a gateway, one that separates our realm from a place of unimaginable destruction. Her rebirth is not a return to the mortal plane, but an invitation to a power that will consume all.

You have become entangled in her web not as her savior, but as her pawn. She has chosen you to lead her to the hosts she needs, and ultimately, to serve as the final piece of her macabre design. Ethan, you must resist her lure.

We, the Society of Shadows, stand ready to assist you. In our archives lies the knowledge and tools you will need to confront Annabelle. But time is fleeting, and her strength grows with every passing hour. Trust no vision she sends you, heed no promise she whispers, and above all, do not underestimate her resolve.

You have the power to end this. Remember: it is not redemption she seeks, but destruction. Protect yourself, Ethan, and prepare for the battle ahead. The fate of not just your town, but of the world, may rest on your shoulders.

May the shadows guide you,
Gideon Hallow
Field Operative, Society of Shadows
